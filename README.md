MonkeyNet
=========

MonkeyNet is a networking engine that uses UDP to implement a reliable real-time protocol for peer-to-peer networks. It is working with IPv6 natively and requieres the host to support this. The API is built in a platform-independant manner with regular builds and tests on Mono.
